There are a total of 4 script in this repo.

**Data_preprocessing** deals with the preprocessing of the data, by cleaning it and splitting it into 2 parts (train and test).

**Neural_train** is a script just to train the neural network, saving the weights in the NNKLD.pth file.

**Testing_NN** uses the test dataset to check if the training was successful or not.

**Map_test** create 2D maps, this is just to validate the results of the network with the current literature.
